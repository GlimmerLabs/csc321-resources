Interactive Ruby
----------------
In a terminal you can open an interactive prompt(IRB) that uses the  ruby interpreter.This could be useful for quick testing/experimenting.
Open a terminal window and type `irb`.

```
albertowusuasare:~/workspace $ irb
2.2.1 :001 > 
```
After the interpreter opens you can begin to interact with it. 
```
2.2.1 :001 > "Hello world"
 => "Hello world" 

2.2.1 :002 > ["Sam","Sum","Some"]
 => ["Sam", "Sum", "Some"] 
 
 2.2.1 :003 > family = {'dog' => 'canine', 'cat' => 'feline', 'donkey' => 'asinine'}                                                    
 => {"dog"=>"canine", "cat"=>"feline", "donkey"=>"asinine"} 
```
You can  exit out of IRB, with any of the following commands `exit`, `quit`, `irb_exit`
```
2.2.1 :004 > irb_exit
albertowusuasare:~/workspace $ 
```
There are alternatives to IRB that you can use. A simple google querry will yield various results. A popular online interpreter is [repl.it] (https://repl.it/languages/ruby)
