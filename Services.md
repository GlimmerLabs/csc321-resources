Various Services that students should have accounts to:

###Cloud 9:

Cloud 9 is a cross browser web application that provides a development environment, supporting various languages including RoR,  in the cloud. Cloud 9 allows various team members to code in real time and provides immense support for peer programming. 
It has many awesome features and I think we will continue to explore it in this class.

###Github : 
Github will be the primary version control tool to use in this class. It allows you to backup code online and save your code during various stages of development

###Heroku : 
Herokuâ€™s platform as a service allows developers to concentrate on the core application and data without worrying too much about the underlying infrastructure for hosting the application. This saves up developer time and hides the nitty gritty details of deployment away from the students. At this point I think Heroku is our best option in terms of pricing and quality of service.

###Slack : 
Slack provided a means for students to communicate among each other to diagnose problems that may come up during homeworks or the team projects. Slack provides the experience of real time team communication which is very common in the industry. 

 

###Trello : 
Trello is a project management tool that is fun to work with and very easy to use. It allowed groups to organise tasks. The structure is simple: boards contain lists and lists contain cards. Each card could represent a particular task that the group wants to accomplished and related tasks could be grouped into lists.  

###Pivotal Tracker (may be?):  
Pivotal Tracker is another project management tool. Its main advantage over Trello is that it is customised specifically for the agile methodology of software development. With Pivotal, there is the concept of user stories and iterations and allows calculation of points and velocity.
